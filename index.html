        <!--<p>Omkar and I worked within the PCM group at Wipro. I have known Omkar is someone who is driven by creativity and at the same time has a strong foot-hold on the Project. He is customer focused and has strong capabilities in the area of Usability and Design space. He has consulted many clients satisfactorily whilst in Wipro. I have directly worked with Omkar and was very happy with his quality deliverables. He is well spoken and committed to his work. I would be more than happy to recommend him for his skills and abilities</p>

        <p>I worked with Omkar when we had to convert the Wireframes to their equivalent templates. He was in fact a person with rare skills. Every project needed his touch.
There were number of occasions he pushed himself to extremes to deliver things in a very short span. Frankly speaking we tried to fit, number of people in his role as Omkar had to context switch projects on a daily basis, but no one could ever be so smart and keep the ball rolling. </p>
